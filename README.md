# Torrent Player

This is a little project that allow you to play music, you need to load the torrents that want's to listen, cause some content can be ilegal and I don't want problems.

Once you add the torrents you cna listen all his music via streaming, free and with no ads.


## Future of this project

In futurre the UI will be more complete with info about the artist, etc. and probably allow to play video.
